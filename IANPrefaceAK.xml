<note>Illustrated Arctic News Preface</note>
<head>Preface</head>
<p>A Polar public having smiled upon us during the long nights of an Arctic Winter, we fear not frowns of the Temperate Gone,- yet being of a peaceable disposition, would deprecate wrath, or jealousy on the part of the Titans of the Southern Press, who may fear our entering the fiels as competitors in these Regions,- by assuring then, that unless Old England be overtaken by a night of three months duration, it is not our intention to appear again in the Editorial line.</p>
<p>Where merit cannot be pleaded, novelty, as in Bloonerism, may avail,- we sincerely hope it will, for the sake of the kind and liberal Publishers, Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Akermann.</p>
<p> A few articles have been omitted, for fear the bad taste of a long-shore Public, might lead them to object, on the score of raciness, for this we apologize to our gallant contributors, and we now in the spirit of our motto, commit the Illustrated Arctic News, safely and fearlessly to the British Public.</p>
